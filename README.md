# ngx-tawk

## Installation
`npm install ngx-tawk` or `yarn install ngx-tawk`

## Usage
An Angular component to integrate Tawk. Built for and tested with Angular 5.

### Module
```
import { NgxTawkModule } from 'ngx-tawk';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    NgxTawkModule
  ]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

### Component
```
<ngx-tawk [id]="tawkId"></ngx-tawk>
```

The `id` parameter is for the string value identifying your account with Tawk. It is a hexadecimal string, 22 characters long, found in the code Tawk suggests you embed during the setup process.

The widget is configured almost entirely within the Tawk dashboard. This component simply causes it to display within your application.
